        <h3>About me</h3>

        <p>I am a second year graduate student in the Computer Science Department at UC Berkeley. I am a part of the AMPLab and I am advised by Ion Stoica and Mike Franklin.</p>

        <p>My research interests are centered around the design of storage systems and analytics platforms for big-data applications.</p>

        <p>In 2009, I completed my Masters at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and worked in the Systems Research Group, under the guidance of Prof. Roy Campbell.  Before that I worked as a Software Engineer at Google in Bangalore for three years and I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India.</p>
